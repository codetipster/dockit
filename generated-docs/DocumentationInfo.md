# DocumentationInfo

# Class: DocumentationInfo
## Package: com.dockit.core.model

## Class Description:

The `DocumentationInfo` class is a core component of the `com.dockit.core.model` package. Its primary responsibility is to manage and store information related to technical documentation, providing a structured way to handle, store, and retrieve documentation data.

This class plays a crucial role in the codebase, serving as the primary data model for all documentation-related operations. It is used across the application to represent and manipulate documentation data, making it a central part of the application's functionality.

`DocumentationInfo` implements the Data Transfer Object (DTO) design pattern. This pattern is used to transfer data between processes, reducing the number of method calls by combining them into a single call. In the context of `DocumentationInfo`, this pattern allows for efficient, structured transfer of documentation data.

Key relationships of the `DocumentationInfo` class include interactions with the `DocumentationService` and `DocumentationController` classes. `DocumentationService` uses instances of `DocumentationInfo` to perform business logic operations, while `DocumentationController` uses `DocumentationInfo` instances to handle HTTP requests and responses.

## Usage:

Developers should use the `DocumentationInfo` class when they need to create, read, update, or delete documentation data. This class provides a structured way to handle such operations, ensuring consistency and efficiency in the application's handling of documentation data.

For example, to create a new piece of documentation, a developer would create a new instance of `DocumentationInfo`, populate it with the necessary data, and then pass it to the appropriate service or controller method.

## Conclusion:

In conclusion, the `DocumentationInfo` class is a crucial part of the `com.dockit.core.model` package. It provides a structured way to handle documentation data, implements the DTO design pattern for efficient data transfer, and interacts with key components like `DocumentationService` and `DocumentationController`. Developers should use this class whenever they need to work with documentation data.
